# Fake_News_Classification using Bi-directional LSTM
## Overview
The Fake News Classifier using Bidirectional LSTM project aims to develop and train a deep learning model to classify news articles as either real or fake. Leveraging the capabilities of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, this project focuses on accurately analyzing and categorizing news content based on textual data.

## Features
Accurate Fake News Detection: Utilizes a Bidirectional LSTM model to distinguish between real and fake news articles.
Comprehensive Text Analysis: Includes NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopwords removal, and padding to prepare text data for the model.
Detailed Preprocessing: Demonstrates the preprocessing steps needed to clean and convert text data into a format suitable for deep learning models.
Model Training and Evaluation: Guides through the process of building, training, and
