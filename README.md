# Fake_News_Classification using Bi-directional LSTM
## Overview
The Fake News Classifier using Bidirectional LSTM project aims to develop and train a deep learning model to classify news articles as either real or fake. Leveraging the capabilities of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, this project focuses on accurately analyzing and categorizing news content based on textual data.
